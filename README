                                JBounce

JBounce is the implementation in the Java programming language of the
JezzBall game[1].  JBounce was the semester project of the course of
Object Oriented Programming of the Computer Science department of the
University of Brasilia.  I wrote JBounce in the two days before the
deadline; so expect a lot of bugs, which I will never fix.
